      <h2>Why I Admire Her 💖</h2>
      <p>
        Mother Teresa, also known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, devoted her life to serving the poorest of the poor. 
        She showed the world that true greatness lies in humility, kindness, and unconditional love. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I deeply admire her ability to see dignity in every human being, regardless of their background or condition. 
        Her life teaches us that even small acts of love can bring immense change to the world. 
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” – Mother Teresa
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Her tireless work in Calcutta and around the world earned her the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.  
        Even today, her legacy inspires millions to serve humanity with love, compassion, and simplicity.
